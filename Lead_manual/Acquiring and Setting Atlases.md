## Acquiring and Installing Atlases

The toolbox comes pre-installed with a few different atlas sets. However, depending on the needs of your study, other subcortical atlases may be installed for the use in the toolbox. Atlases that are available in standard nifti format (.nii or .img/.hdr extensions) can be used with LEAD DBS if they are available in standard stereotactic (MNI) space.

On [this page](http://www.lead-dbs.org/?page_id=45) you can find information about how and where to obtain other subcortical atlases suitable for 2D/3D-visualization using _Lead-DBS_.

If an atlas you know of is missing on this page, please contact us so we can add it to our list. If possible, we are also interested in distributing other subcortical atlases alongside the toolbox if they are made available for distribution.
