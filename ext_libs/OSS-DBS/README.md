## OSS-DBS: Open-Source Simulation Platform for Deep Brain Stimulation
![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/SFB-ELAINE/OSS-DBS/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)

An open-source package that comprises
CAD and CAE tools for highly automated
evaluation of electric field distribution and neural activation during Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS). Details can be found in "Butenko K, Bahls C, Schroeder M, Koehling R, van Rienen U (2020) 'OSS-DBS: Open-source simulation platform for deep brain stimulation with a comprehensive automated modeling.' PLoS Comput Biol 16(7): e1008023. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008023."

### Getting Started

Please refer to OSS-DBS - tutorial.pdf, which provides instructions for installation and testing.

### Repository Structure

Folder OSS_Platform is the core of OSS-DBS and it contains all files necessary to run simulations in the platform.
The rest is documentation and Docker files. If you prefer to run the platform without Docker, install the software as listed in dockerfiles from docker/base and docker/fenics19.
