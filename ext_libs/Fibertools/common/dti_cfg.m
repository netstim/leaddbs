For each application which is known to the batch system, a separate pulldown menu lists the available modules. Depending on the application, these modules may be grouped into submenus. Application specific defaults can be edited by choosing "Edit Defaults" from the application menu. The toolbar offers some shortcuts to frequently used operations (e.g. load, save, run).'
