NOTE: This folder contains legacy code, and is not recommended
===============================================

The code available in this directory has known behaviors that are problematic when using fMRI CIFTI data processed with HCP templates.  For fMRI CIFTI data, we recommend and provide support for using the code in the root of this repository, or legacy ciftiopen/ciftisave/ciftisavereset (available at [the HCP-Users FAQ](https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/docs/HCP%20Users%20FAQ.html), FAQ #2, option II).

This legacy folder contains an old subset of the MATLAB code from the FieldTrip and the SPM toolboxes. It exists for users that developed their code arount the v1 version of this repository, and is not recommended for new users of fMRI CIFTI data.

See http://www.humanconnectome.org for details on the HCP.
